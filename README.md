# Bluetek
As a key contributor to the Bluetek project, I successfully designed and developed 5 unique landings and profiles, including Bluetek, Blue Swap, Blue Market, Blue Lands, and Blockchain Game.'
This involved creating over 15 HTML pages that were both visually appealing and user-friendly.
My expertise in UI design and vanilla coding allowed me to effectively structure each page to meet the specific needs of the crypto-focused website.
